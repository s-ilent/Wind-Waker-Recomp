# The Builder

The Builder turns a player's own game disc into their own app, on their own Mac. Nothing it produces is
published: the game code is translated from the player's disc during the build and stays on their Mac
and device. This is how BlueWake is distributed. Players get the source and build their personal IPA
themselves ([Build your own BlueWake](BUILD_YOUR_OWN.md)).

```sh
scripts/builder/build.sh "/path/to/The Legend Of Zelda The Wind Waker.iso" --ipa build/BlueWake.ipa
```

`scripts/ios/build_device.sh` is the same command with the BlueWake profile preselected; it takes the same
options. `--help` lists them.

## Pipeline and profile

The Builder has two parts:

- **The pipeline**, `scripts/builder/build.sh`, is the same for every game. It parses options, checks the
  Mac's tools, runs the game's steps in order with a log per step, embeds the game module in the app,
  signs it (ad hoc, or with the player's identity and provisioning profile), writes the unsigned IPA,
  and installs with `devicectl` when asked. It refuses to write an IPA anywhere inside the repository
  that git could commit.
- **A profile**, `scripts/builder/profiles/NAME.sh`, holds everything specific to one game: which disc it
  accepts, the pinned translator and runtime, how the translated code is generated and checked, the mods,
  and the app target. `--game NAME` selects it; the default is `bluewake`.

The steps are:

| Step | Who | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 tools | pipeline + `profile_check_tools` | Xcode, iOS SDK, CMake 3.25+, Ninja, plus the game's extras |
| 2 dependencies | `profile_dependencies` | Fetch pinned sources (commit hashes, checksums) |
| 3 extract | `profile_extract` | Read the disc; refuse the wrong game or revision |
| 4 translate | `profile_translate` | Translate the game's code to C |
| 5 generate | `profile_generate` | Assemble the source to compile; compare it with the verified digest |
| 6 mods | `profile_mods` | Optional code mods (skipped with `--no-mods`) |
| training | `profile_train` | Default (`--no-train` skips): local instrumented Mac build and playback; records a private game profile |
| 7 compile | `profile_compile` | Compile the game module (the long step); set `module` |
| 8 app | `profile_build_app`, then pipeline | Build the app, set `app`; the pipeline embeds and signs |
| 9 package | pipeline | `--ipa` and `--install` |

`--source-only` stops after step 5, so a player can check their disc and tools in minutes before the long
compile. Compatible compilation work and completed matching profiles are reused. Interrupted training
playback starts again; source-only does not exercise that stage.

## Writing a profile for another port

A profile is a shell file sourced by the pipeline. It sets:

| Variable | Example (BlueWake) |
| --- | --- |
| `PROFILE_NAME`, `PROFILE_TITLE` | `bluewake`, the game title and disc revision |
| `PROFILE_APP_NAME`, `PROFILE_BUNDLE_ID` | `BlueWake`, `dev.bluewake.BlueWake` |
| `PROFILE_MODULE` | `gGZLE01_recomp.dylib`: the file name the app loads from `Frameworks/` |
| `PROFILE_DEFAULT_OUT` | `build/device` (must be git-ignored) |
| `PROFILE_HAS_MODS` | `1` or `0` |

and defines the required `profile_*` hooks in the table above. `profile_train` is required unless
players always pass `--no-train` or `--no-pgo`. Hooks may use the pipeline's helpers
(`run LOGNAME cmd...`, `die`, `pgo_flags FILE`) and variables (`root`, `out`, `logs`, `jobs`, `iso`,
`opt_level`, `device_cpu`, `composite_pgo`, `host_pgo`, `accept_new`, `mods`). `profile_compile` must
set `module` and `profile_build_app` must set `app`.

A port's profile has to answer three questions, which are also its safety checks:

1. **Which disc?** Refuse anything but the exact game and revision the port was verified with (BlueWake
   checks the disc ID and the executable's hash).
2. **Which translator?** Pin every source by commit or checksum, so every player's build is the same.
3. **Is the result the verified one?** Compare the generated source with a recorded digest before
   compiling, so a wrong disc or translator fails in minutes instead of producing a broken app hours later.

A port whose app builds differently only changes its `profile_build_app`.

A platform port of the same game goes further: its profile sources the game's
profile and overrides the platform hooks (`profile_check_tools`,
`profile_dependencies`, `profile_train`, `profile_compile`,
`profile_build_app`), reusing the disc checks, translator settings and digests
unchanged. `bluewake-linux.sh` is the example; the pipeline's macOS-only steps
(embedding, codesign, IPA) only run for a `.app` bundle.

## Progress and build time

The terminal reports the active stage and elapsed time, with available compiler progress. A
`logs/progress.jsonl` event stream under the output directory records stage state for future PadForge
integration. Individual command logs remain under `logs/`; a failed stage reports its log path.
Measured on an M3 Max with 16 jobs on 2026-09-28, from a fresh clone of the public repository:
the tools, dependencies, disc checks, translation and mods took about 2 minutes, and local training
(its Mac test build plus playback) took 23 minutes. Its training profile matched an earlier
independent run to within 84 counts out of 469 billion. Compiling the game module takes about
80 minutes at the default `-O2` (78m42s in an earlier run with a local profile), so expect a first
build of about 1 hour 45 minutes on that Mac and longer on smaller ones. `--no-train` saves the
23 minutes. The build needs about 10 GB in `build/` and writes a 96 MB IPA.

A lighter `-O1` build was measured the same day as a faster option: it compiled in 47 minutes, but on an
iPad Pro (M2) at the Outset Island pier it averaged 26.1 FPS with the CPU at 99 percent (121 one-second
samples, none at 29 FPS or above), where the owner's build holds 30. It was dropped: it saves about half an
hour and loses the game's frame rate.

## Optimization profiles

The game module and the app are compiled with LLVM profile-guided optimization (PGO) when profiles are
available. The BlueWake profile bundles two in `scripts/builder/profiles/bluewake/`, both trained on the
macOS host: `composite-rt.profdata` (the runtime's dispatch, memory and CPU helpers) and `host.profdata` (the
app's host code: renderer glue, input, DSP). They contain profiling metadata for runtime and host
functions, including third-party code, rather than executable instructions. Both pass the automated asset scan; that scan alone is not a
provenance or licensing determination. `--no-pgo` skips them.

The developer's third profile records translated game functions and stays private. The player
build generates a replacement locally from the player's disc, by default (`--no-train` skips it),
through a separate instrumented Mac build and headless playback. It requires
reaching player control and executing translated functions before accepting a profile. The optional
`--training-save FILE` uses a copy of the player's BlueWake memory card; the default creates a new one.
The resulting `OUT/pgo-local/composite.profdata` stays local and is added to the device build. The
bundled host profile remains in use because headless training does not cover the renderer.
Measurements on 2026-09-28 used an iPad Pro (M2) at the Outset pier and the same scripted route:

| Build | FPS | CPU |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No profiles | 26.0 | 99% |
| The two bundled profiles | 27.5 | 99% |
| All three (the developer's build) | 29.9 | 83% |

A locally trained game module has not yet been measured on the iPad. On the Mac, four alternating
runs of the same saved-game route (developer, local, local, developer) produced identical game-state
records, and the local module averaged 13.26 ms per frame against the developer module's 13.62 ms.
That is CPU evidence from a headless test, not an iPad frame rate.

## PadForge

[PadForge](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/padforge) is the shared Mac builder being developed for
multiple ports. Its experimental Python CLI wraps the existing BlueWake and KartPad backends, with
source revision checks, progress, cancellation and local build records. A real BlueWake source-only
run has passed; complete packaging and device acceptance are separate checks. A graphical Mac app
remains future work and is not required by the direct builder instructions above.

Each game backend owns disc validation, translation, mods and optimization training. See the
[PadForge handoff](PADFORGE_HANDOFF.md) for the interface and validation status. Local profile
generation and matched-device performance verification remain release requirements.

## What is public and what is not

Public source must exclude translated or decompiled game code, disc data, signing keys and saves.
`scripts/release/check_public_assets.sh` scans candidate public artifacts and fails closed; its
heuristics supplement manual provenance review. Gameplay screenshots illustrate the documentation.
The IPA the Builder writes contains the player's translated game module (`gGZLE01_recomp.dylib`): it is a personal build
and is never uploaded, attached or shared (AGENTS.md).
